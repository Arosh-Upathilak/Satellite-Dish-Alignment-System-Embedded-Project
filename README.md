## Description

The Satellite Dish Alignment System is an embedded project designed to enhance the precision and efficiency of satellite dish positioning. This system comprises a **Master Unit** and a **Slave Unit**, working collaboratively to ensure optimal alignment with communication satellites.

### Key Features
- **Master Unit**: Responsible for controlling the alignment process and interfacing with the user.
- **Slave Unit**: Executes the alignment commands with high precision, adjusting the satellite dish orientation.
- **Embedded Control**: Utilizes embedded systems for seamless communication and real-time adjustments.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Designed to achieve precise satellite alignment with minimal manual intervention.
